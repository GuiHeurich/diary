#A Secret Diary

## How it works

This is your Secret Diary app. Please open 'diary.rb' and create a new object of the SecretDiary class. You can call it whatever you want. Your dairy starts locked by default, but you can open it by calling ```(your diary's name).unlock``` . Once opened, you can add entries to your diary and also view all of your stored entries!

Have fun!
